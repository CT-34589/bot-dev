# Set Up
You will need several things set up before you can even begin to start coding.
## **Python 3.11**
You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/). \
make sure to check the box that says "Add Python 3.11 to PATH".

## Code editor 
I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or PyCharm. \
*If choosing pycharm install their tool box app [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)*
and then install PyCharm **Community Edition** from there. (this is the free version)

## **Git**
You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). \
Not necessary but it is recommended to use git for version control. If using github for version control, you will need to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and make an account. \
*it is recommended to have a backup of code somewhere not just on your device, github is a popular choice.*

## **Discord**
****
### You must have 2FA enabled on your discord account to be able to create bots
****

Head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. \
Once you have created the application, go to the "Bot" tab and create a bot. \
You will need the bot token for your code. \
*Do not share this token with anyone, it is essentially your bot's password.*

once you have done this, you can start coding your bot.
